\f0\fs24 \cf0 I\'92m proud of this code because I learned how to use HTTP requests in order to make API calls, and learned about client-server communications and APIs (in DarkSkyWeather.java and SmsSender.java). I\'92m also proud of it because I added abstraction by creating a WeatherService interface. By having the different weather services (DarkSkyWeather and DefaultWeather) implement this interface I was able to make the code less coupled and more flexible for possibly adding other weather service options.\
